<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game:-</h1>

</ul>

<p> This is a small tic-tac-toe game project using all the above tech stack. I am so happy that I levelled up in the frontend development that is into javascript. And also while doing the frontend design in HTML
and CSS, I myself designed with my own knowledge and also learning new options in CSS. Coming to Javascript, the main thing, I learned a lot where to use functions and write the code in a modular way.
